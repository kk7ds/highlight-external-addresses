This is an extension for Mozilla Thunderbird. It highlights email
addresses based on the sender's domain in order to alert the sender
when a message is being sent both to internal (same domain) and
external (different domain) recipients. The goal is to make it more
obvious when a thread includes internal and external recipients to
avoid accidental disclosures.

The code is licensed under the GPLv3.

This is installable via the Mozilla Thunderbird Add-On Manager,
or from the listing here:
